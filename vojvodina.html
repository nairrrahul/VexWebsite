			Vojvodina is part of Serbia, and was even considered one of two autonomous provinces in the republic (the other one being Kosovo). After the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Vojvodina remained part of Serbia & Montenegro (and later just Serbia), and is located in the northern portion of modern-day Serbia. As a result of their cultural history, the majority of individuals in the region speak Serbian, though Hungarian, Croatian, Rusyn, Slovak, and Romanian are all official languages.

		<td class = "ab-td">
			 Vojvodina is located in the northern portion of Serbia, and takes up approximately one-thirds of the country's size. Vojvodina contains three historical regions (Backa, Banat, Srem), which all are influenced by a certain degree to similar or bordering nations. Vojvodina contains mostly of plains, flatlands, and has some lakes; the highest point in Vojvodina is less than 650 meters tall, as the region does not have many mountain ranges in it.

			<div style="color:#DD0000; font-size: 20px;">Red:</div>
			The Red in the Vojvodinan flag correlates to the red portion of the tricolor present on the Serbian flag. The red on the Serbian flag originates from a flag made for King Vladislav I in 1241; the exact meaning of the red in that time period is unknown. Given that the flag was often-utilized in battle, the red likely symbolized the blood shed to maintain the integrity and sovereignity of the Serbian people, an attitude certainly prevalent even in the modern day (following the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s).
			<div style="color:#003893; font-size: 20px;">Blue:</div>
			The Blue on the Vojvodinan flag represents the blue portion of the Serbian tricolor. Like with the red, the blue on the serbian flag first appeared the the flag created for Vladislav I back in 1241. Moreover, most Serbian revolutionary flags (in the 1740s) also contained some form of blue in a tricolor color scheme. The blue likely represents the purity of Serbians (or something similar); given that Serbians often exhibited views of ethnic superiority in the Yugoslav breakup, such a view certainly proves a likely motivating factor for that color on the flag.
			<div style="color:#black; font-size: 20px;">White:</div>
			The White on the Vojvodinan flag, just like with the red and blue, is also supposed to correlate to the Serbian tricolor present on their flag. Unlike the red and blue, however, white did not appear on Serbian flags until the 1740s, and only became an integral portion of the flag until 1835. White, like blue, also likely represents strength or purity of the Serbian people. White was also present on numerous Serbian revolutionary flags that originated from Vojvodina; as such, the color likely contains a local significance.
			<div style="color:#AA9708; font-size: 20px;">3 Stars:</div>
			The three yellow stars present in the center of the Vojvodinan flag represent the three regions which make up the region: Backa, Banat, and Srem. Backa takes up the north-western portion of the region; Banat, the east, and Srem, the south-western portion. The yellow contains many potential interpretations, but most relate to the influence of agriculture on the region (eg. Corn, the Sun, etc.). Yellow was also present on numerous proposed Vojvodinan flags during the 1990s; therefore, its presence on the regional flag likely correlates to a degree of both cultural and political autonomy.
