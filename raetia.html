			Although not an officially recognized autonomous territory in any of its constituent nations, Raetia still encompasses a variety of lingustic regions. German proves the most widely-spoken language (due to its prevalence in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria), yet Lombard likely is spoken due to Raetia's presence in Lombardy. Raetia also encompasses the Italian and Romansh-speaking regions of Switzerland.
		</td>
		<td class = "ab-td">
			Raetia is located mostly in modern-day Switzerland and southern Germany, with portions also present in Tyrol of Austria and northern Lombardy in Italy. Raetia's northern border is located on the river Danube (like with the rest of the Roman Empire). Raetia proves largely mountainous due to its location in the Alps, yet was founded during the earlier stages of Pax Romana, around 15 AD.

			Raetia was a region of the Roman Empire, located in modern-day Switzerland and Germany. Raetia largely proves an archaic region, yet it contains a soccer team competitive in the ConIFA World Cup.

			<div style="color:#1456A2; font-size: 20px;">Blue:</div>
			Raetia’s Blue Hue likely contains some representation of the various rivers present within its borders; it lies in one of Switzerland’s most river-and-lake-riddled regions. Rivers also prove a major settling point, thus proving important during the times of the Romans. Another potential explanation for Raetia’s blue tone also correlates to the natural beauty of Switzerland; with blue usually representing more peaceful, nature-based aspects of a region, blue could encompass all of the region’s pristine nature, as opposed to solely rivers.
			<br />
			<div style="color:black; font-size: 20px;">White:</div>
			Raetia’s White Color is likely indicative of two possibilities: Swiss temperament or Alpine Colors. The Swiss are well-known for their neutral stance, and as Raetia as a region with a strong identity didn’t exist during the time of the Romans, it is definitely a possibility that the white color is a sign of neutrality, an inability to take sides of a color-based level (eg. red v blue). Raetia is also at the crossroads of the alpine Switzerland and industrial Germany, and given that the large proportion of the population is Swiss, the white could also represent the mountainous nature of the terrain, a more cultural representation on the flag.
			<div style="color:#8A8A88; font-size: 20px;">Gray:</div>
			Raetia’s Gray Tone, as the last color on the flag, could either prove the amalgamation of the hues of the grayscaled version of the other two colors present on the flag, but likely represents the industrial side of the region. While one portion lays in Switzerland, a decently-sized section of Raetia lies in Germany, which is considered one of the more industrialized nations of the land. Thus, the Gray likely represents industry, with cobblestone and brick replacing the land in more populated areas.
