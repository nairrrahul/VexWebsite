			South Ossetia has 3 regionally spoken languages: Ossetian, Georgian, and Russian. Ossetian and Russian, however, are the only two officially recognized languages in the region, likely due to an overarching need for Ossetians to separate themselves from Georgia. The vast majority (~90%) of the region is Ossetian, with around 7.4% proving Georgian and slightly over 1% of the region proving the home of Russians.

		<td class = "ab-td">
			South Ossetia is an autonomous, separatist region located in the north of Georgia (in the Caucasus), in the region right below the Georgian-Russian border. South Ossetia declared independence from Georgia in 1991, yet is largely unrecognized internationally. South Ossetia has fought multiple wars against Georgia following their declaration, the most recent of which occurred in 2008, the aftermath of which led to extensive Russian military occupation in the region.

			The South Ossetian flag was created by former revolution leader Alan Chochiev. The horizontal tricolor pattern of the flag represents the social system present in the Ossetian region: military-based aristocracy, clergy, and commoners.

			<div style="color:#black; font-size: 20px;">White:</div>
			White symbolizes the moral purity of the Ossetian People. Although Ossetians experienced a high degree of autonomy under Soviet rule (eg. Ossetian language was prevalent in schools in such a region), life under Georgian rule failed to reach the level of self-governance desired. Their moral purity thus contrasts the allegedly oppressive role of the Georgians; moreover, on an Aristocratic standpoint, upper classes were largely regarded as more morally pure than commoners. Due to their basis in the military, the higher-ups in society would have to lead battles against rivals and invaders, cementing their purity in regards to culture.
			<br />
			<div style="color:#FF0000; font-size: 20px;">Red:</div>
			The red on the flag represents courage in war and battle. Despite South Ossetia's modern-day status as a small territory within Georgia, Ossetic people share a similar culture to Circassians, Hunnic regions, and even with the Tatars of Crimea. All of these groups, centuries ago, largely functioned as hordes, which often proves synonymous with city-razing and an overall war-bearing attitude. Separationism often correlates with cultural pride, thus, the bright red adeptly present symbolizes the Ossetian past and consequent skill and valor in battles and warfare.
			<div style="color:#917D00; font-size: 20px;">Yellow:</div>
			South Ossetia's yellow hue proves a symbolization of the region's wealth and prosperity. Even though the Caucasus contains many mineral-rich mines (which can thus properly fuel a burgeoning economy), prosperity likely relates to the rich culture of the Ossetic culture group. Due to their close relation with Russia, Ossetians thus identify more with Russian cultural elements than the present Georgian ones. Such a viewpoint coincides with the separatist tone of the region; a contrast in cultures implies a view of one's superiority over the other, thus indicating their overall prosperous nature.
