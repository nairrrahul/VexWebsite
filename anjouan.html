			Anjouan, as part of the Comoros, has a population that speaks the local Comorian language. As a result, the island is not as linguistically diverse as mainland regions (eg. Raetia); however, other languages present in Comoros like French and Arabic are also utilized in education and schooling. The local Comorian language (also called Shindzuani) contains a largely Bantu influence.

		<td class = "ab-td">
			 Anjouan, the easternmost island of Comoros, is a highly separatist island which was home to a recent coup and invasion in 2008. Anjouan occasionally experiences short spells of volcanism due to it being largely composed of a dormant shield volcano; thus, the island's highest point is located in its centermost region. Anjouan largely experiences tropical-like weather, with highs generally approaching 90 deg. F.

			The Anjouan flag was officially developed in 2012, and contains a 3:2 aspect ratio. Anjouan's former, far more recognizable flag contained a hand over an upwards-facing crescent.

			<div style="color:#black; font-size: 20px;">White:</div>
			White, like on the official flag of Comoros, is one of the four main pan-Arab colors. White is often worn on days of prayer or days of peace in Arab nations, and generally represents the more peace-faring side of the religion. Moreover, red and white proves a common color scheme present in Arab or Muslim countries (eg. Tunisia, Turkey, etc.); thus, white likely proves to complement the red background to form a distinct color scheme. 
			<div style="color:#CE1126; font-size: 20px;">Red:</div>
			The Red on the Anjouan flag mirrors the role of the red on the flag of Comoros; after all, the red stripe on the Comorian flag represents their claim to the island of Anjouan. Red, a common symbol for blood and warfare, also proves a perfectly representative color to utilize given the connotation of blood and warfare with secession, along with the island's violent and volcanic past (both geologically (volcano) and politically (multiple coup d'etats)).
			<div style="color:#black; font-size: 20px;">Crescent and Stars:</div>
			The Crescent and Stars on the Anjouan flag proves an exact copy of the same insignia present on the actual Comorian flag. While the old flag contained a distinct hand and crescent, the creation of the new flag seemed a government-based effort to separate Anjouan from its separatist past and constitution. Regarding the 4 stars and crescent on the Comoros flag, the stars represent claims to the 3 Comorian islands + Mayotte, while the Crescent exhibits the region's main religion, Islam.
